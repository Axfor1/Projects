# My Website
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S3SaDVSmIk>
#### Description:
open project directory Use http-server then click index.html

In this code, I made myself a website that people can visit.

This website will be used in the future for my youtube channel with links and all the likes. I at first was going to make a full list of all the things I enjoy, but then I decided to make a seperate list for each genre. Overall I believe it would look more neat and overall help the aesthetic of the website. I used a template for my homepage which I decided to upgrade and make a fully funtional blog/webpage for my self. I implemented javascript, Html, and other things that could help me along the way. This was a very interesting project that gave me ideas that could help my business in the future. This website can help someone get to know me better. In the future I will implement an area to sell things.


## Final project website autobiography esque website

### Sell
This things I will sell are things such as courses for anything im in such as fitness all the way to coding as things I do on my channel.

## future ideas
I plan on adding a store for new things. I plan on adding a more user friendly site. I plan on intergrading a social media on my website where my supporters can converse such as a discord channel but made by me.

I also plan on making this website accesible to other creators that want to reach out to their supporters and better connect with their supporters. This was cs50 and a fun experience!


# Specification

## Things gained through the entirety of the cs50 program from edx
One thing I ganed from cs50 that was very useful to me was remembering to never give up. Another thing I gained from the program was the sharpening of my skills such as python and sql implementation. These are skills that will travel and move with me for a long time. Skills that are very useful can be gained from partaking in cs50. This program has left me with a lot, more than I could've imagined and It taught me a lot of necessary and useful things that can help me in the near or fairly distant future. Cs50 is an inspirational program that I will be refering to other people trying to get a better understanding of coding as a whole. Learning python javascript css C html SQL and more has been very beneficial to me I would say. I appreciate the lectures too seeing as I didn't even know I was capable of sitting through that length of an lecture for so long at home when there are a few distractions around me at almost all times. This program opened my eyes to new possibilities and I appreciate the creators and helpers of it.

## Cs50
Cs50 at the beginning was intimidating to say the least. After doing scratch I thought it would be a breeze then I saw the next ones and almost gave up, but I didn't. Im thankful for the experience brought to me by cs50. I believe cs50 was a very entertaining and fairly difficult course. It was fun and I gained a lot of information that will be helpful to me in the coming years. This was an exiting journey I would do again.
